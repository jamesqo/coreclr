{
    // This class implements a lockless/thread-safe array cache.
    // All of the state is held in t_array, which is ThreadStatic
    // so every thread gets its own copy of the field.

    // Methods:
    // Acquire - Rents an array from the cache, or allocates a new one.
    // Release - Returns the array to the cache if it's not too big.
    // Fast* - These methods expose some implementation details about the class,
    //         and make some assumptions about the caller, in exchange for faster
    //         performance. (see below)

    // Like StringBuilderCache, a typical use of this class could be like this:
    // var array = ArrayCache<T>.Acquire(length);
    // ...do work with array...
    // ArrayCache<T>.Release(array); // return when done

    // However, this is somewhat inefficient. ThreadStatic field accesses can
    // be very slow compared to normal ones- and we're making 3 of them.
    // Acquire does 2, one to read t_array and one to set it to null.
    // Release also does 1, to set the field back to the original value.

    // Since the last 2 essentially cancel each other out, we can
    // skip them if we know none of our callees call {Fast}Acquire
    // before we call {Fast}Release, hence the Fast* overloads. You
    // can use them like this:

    // bool wasCached;
    // var array = ArrayCache<T>.FastAcquire(length, out wasCached);
    // ...do work with array...
    // ArrayCache<T>.FastRelease(array, wasCached);

    // The wasCached parameter is necessary because it allows us
    // to not write anything during FastRelease if t_array already
    // contains that value (which will be the common case).
    // This leaves only 1 ThreadStatic access: the initial read
    // of t_array.

    // If t_array was originally null or the minimumLength specified
    // during FastAcquire was bigger than the currently cached array's
    // length, we do one additional access to write to t_array.

    // More notes:

    // Unlike StringBuilderCache, we do not clear the array when calling Acquire.
    // It's up to you to null it out once you rent the array.

    // You may also wish to clear the array before returning it, if:
    // - T is a reference type or contains reference types
    //   This will allow the GC to collect them as soon as
    //   you're done with them.
    // - The array contains sensitive data
    // Note that for the first scenario above, it may be smarter
    // to only clear if the array is actually returned to the pool.
    // (Otherwise if the array is unreachable, the references will
    // still get collected anyway.) You can do this via
    // if (ArrayCache<T>.Release(array)) Array.Clear(array, 0, length);
    // Since the field is ThreadStatic, there's no risk another thread
    // will see t_array before it's finished clearing.

    // As a final note, if T is a reference type you may wish to
    // use the Internal.RefAsValueType wrapper. This will elide
    // covariant type checks by the CLR, or at least until
    // https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/6537 is fixed
    // for sealed classes.
